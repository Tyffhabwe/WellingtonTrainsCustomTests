# WellingtonTrainsCustomTests

Tests to help with building each stage of the assignment
## NOTE: These tests just print to the console to make it as easy as possible to set up. All they do is through a simple happy case stolen from the past exams.

To run things:
- Just drag and drop this .java file into the WellingtonTransport folder.
- To run the tests run the main method inside the CustomTests class and look at output.
